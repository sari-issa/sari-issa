## 👋 Hi there, I'm Sari Issa!


I'm currently pursuing my MSc at ETH Zurich, specializing in Machine Learning and Deep Learning, with a keen interest in their applications in Genomics and Healthcare.

- 🔭 **Current Focus:** My Master thesis focuses on interpretable graph representation learning framework for tumor microenviroment modelling. It is a collaboration between the Rapsomaniki Lab at CHUV (AI/ML for Biomedicine) and Boeva Lab at ETH Zurich (Computational Cancer Genomics)
- 🌱 **Learning Journey:** Learning all about Deep Learning techniques for Genomics and Healthcare applications.

## 🚀 Projects

Here are some notable projects I've worked on:

- **[Semantics-Informed Group Interventions for Concept Bottleneck Models](https://github.com/sari-issa/semantic-CBM):** We introduce a semantics-informed clustered realignment framework for Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), enhancing interpretability by constraining interventions to semantically meaningful groups while maintaining competitive performance.
Co-authors: Mihal Mikuta, Mikael Makonnen, Max Buckley
- **[Prediction of Gene Expression from Chromatin Landscape](https://github.com/sari-issa/gene_expression_chromatin):** Project was conducted as a part of the Machine Learning for Genomics course at ETH. The code leverages an LSTM model to predict gene expression from histone modification and DNase accessibility data.
